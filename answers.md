## Atoms: Atoms are the smallest building blocks of a design, typically a single CSS property or value. 

    * display: flex;
    * align-items: center;
    * position: absolute;
    * left: 50%;
    * transform: translate(-50%);
    * text-decoration: none;
    * color: black;
    * font-size: xx-large;
    * list-style: none;
    * gap: 25px;
    * justify-content: center;

## Molecules: Molecules are a way to organize CSS code by grouping together related CSS styles that form a coherent and standalone component. 

    * .main-nav{...}
    * .sub-nav{...}
    * .login-btn{...}

## Organisms: Organisms are a way to organize CSS code by grouping together related molecules that form a larger and more complex section of the website. These sections can be repeated in different parts of the website and can include multiple instances of the same molecules.

    header{...} A header section that includes the styles for the logo, the main navigation menu, and the search bar.
    footer{...} A footer section that includes the styles for the copyright text, the social media icons, and the links to the terms of use and privacy policy.

## Variables: Variables refer to values that are reused across multiple CSS properties. They are used to make it easier to update the design and keep it consistent. 
    * max-width: 1100px;
    * height: 70px;
    * margin: 10px;
    * right: 10px;
    * border-bottom: 2px solid lightgray;
    * border-top: 2px solid lightgray;

## Critical CSS:

    Critical CSS refers to the CSS that is necessary for the initial load of the website, to ensure that the layout and design are rendered correctly without waiting for all the other CSS to load. In this CSS code, all the CSS is necessary for the visual design of the website, so there is no critical CSS.
